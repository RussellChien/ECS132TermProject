\chapter{The Normal Family}
\section{Communities and Crime: pctWWage}

Our group observed that the variable \textbf{pctWWage} of the Communities and Crime dataset seemed well-approximated by the normal family of continuous distributions.
According to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, \textbf{pctWWage} is described as the percentage of households within the United States with wage or salary income in 1989.

\chapter{The Exponential Family}
\section{Communities and Crime: PctLargHouseFam}

For the exponential family of continuous distributions, we observed that the variable \textbf{PctLargHouseFam} was a suitable approximation. 
According to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, \textbf{PctLargHouseFam} is described as the percentage of family households with six or more family members.

\chapter{The Gamma Family}
\section{Communities and Crime: PctNotHsGrad}

We observed that the variable \textbf{PctNotHsGrad} of the Communities and Crime dataset seemed well-approximated by the gamma family of continuous distributions.
According to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, \textbf{PctNotHsGrad} is described as the percentage of people 25 and over that are not high school graduates.

\chapter{The Beta Family}
\section{Communities and Crime: PctNotSpeakEnglWell}

For the beta family of continuous distributions, we observed that the variable \textbf{PctNotSpeakEnglWell} was a suitable approximation. 
According to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, \textbf{PctNotSpeakEnglWell} is described as the percentage of people who do not speak English well.
